**Baseball Stat Finder**


# Project Summary 


Baseball Stat Finder is an application that searches through season statistics for every current Major Leauge Baseball player. The user selects a year to search through, and up to 3 stats to filter by. The application will generate a table based on those parameters. 

**Example:**
  
  The user selects:   
  - Year = 2002
  - Games >= 50
  - Batting Avg >=.250
  - Home Runs <= 20
  
The program would return a table that only shows players that 1) played in at least 50 games, 2) had a batting average of at least .250 and 3)hit no more than 20 home runs in the 2002 season. Here is the table that would be shown: ![IMG1](http://i.imgur.com/3EY0ULt.png)
